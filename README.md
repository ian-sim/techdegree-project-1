Random Quote Generator
This is a simple program that generates a random quote to be displayed on screen each time a user clicks the 'show another quote' button or when the auto-refresh function displays a new quote.
The quotes are pulled from objects stored in the array quotes and are used to display the quote and source as well as any other information if there is any.
There is also a function to select a random background color each time a new quote is displayed.
